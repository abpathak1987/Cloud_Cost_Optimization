Cloud Cost Optimizer
Project Overview
The Cloud Cost Optimizer is an AI-driven solution designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize cloud resource usage and costs in real-time. This project aims to provide businesses with automated cost control, data-driven decision-making capabilities, and significant cloud expenditure savings.

Core Components
1. Real-Time Monitoring (real_time_monitor.py)
pythonCopyclass RealTimeMonitor:
    def process_real_time_data(self, new_data):
        # Detects cost anomalies using IsolationForest
        # Analyzes usage patterns
        # Generates alerts for unusual spending
Key Features:

Anomaly detection using machine learning
Real-time cost tracking
Automated alerts for spending spikes

2. AI Recommendations (recommendation_engine.py)
pythonCopyclass RecommendationEngine:
    def analyze_resource_usage(self, data):
        # Analyzes resource sizing
        # Identifies cost optimization opportunities
        # Suggests scheduling improvements
Benefits:

Resource right-sizing recommendations
Cost-saving opportunities identification
Usage pattern optimization

3. Automation (action_executor.py)
pythonCopyclass ActionExecutor:
    def execute_scheduled_actions(self):
        # Implements recommendations automatically
        # Enforces cost policies
        # Schedules resource scaling
Features:

Automated cost optimization
Policy enforcement
Resource scheduling

4. Visualization (cost_visualizer.py)
pythonCopyclass CostVisualizer:
    # Creates various cost analysis charts:
    # - Service costs (pie chart)
    # - Cost trends (line chart)
    # - Usage patterns (heatmap)
5. Main Orchestrator (orchestrator.py)
pythonCopyclass CloudCostOptimizer:
    def start_monitoring(self, data_source):
        # Coordinates all components
        # Processes data continuously
        # Updates dashboards
Testing & Results
pythonCopy# test_optimizer.py
optimizer = CloudCostOptimizer()
results = optimizer.monitor.process_real_time_data(data)
Demo Results:

Cost anomalies detected: X
Recommendations generated: Y
Potential savings: Z%

Business Benefits

Reduced cloud costs through AI-driven optimization
Automated cost control
Real-time monitoring and alerts
Data-driven decision making
